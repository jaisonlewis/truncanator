# truncanator
Truncates any text difference between files in two different directories
If you ave two directories with the same files and starting with the same set of letters but for some reason the name has an additonal few characters at the end. 
This will use the file names of directory 1  and make sure the file names in directory 2 match it. 
No idea where and when you will need this. But it now exists.
